Object Orbiting Earth — Frontend

This is the frontend application for Object Orbiting Earth, a web platform that visualizes satellite positions and orbits in real time.
Built with Angular, it communicates with the backend services to retrieve processed orbital data and displays satellite trajectories on an interactive map.
The goal of this interface is to offer a clean, responsive, and intuitive experience for exploring objects orbiting our planet.
